<h2>Plugin development and API</h2>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p>Each plugin is implemented as a script placed in the <em>plugins</em> folder having the extension .plugin.js.</p>

<p>Individial plugins are registered with the system and placed in the editor context menu by adding them to
<em>plugins/plugins.json</em>, each line having the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Contextmenu path&quot;: &quot;filename_without_extension&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The context menu path is similar to a normal UNIX path (using forward slashes), with each path element
corresponding to a subgroup in the menu and the leaf node being the name of the plugin itself. The name declared here is used for 
display purposes only. It's used for the context menu and is the default node name for newly created plugin
instances.</p>

<h3>Plugin conceptual operation:</h3>

<p>Each plugin can be roughly categorized into one of three groups:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Generators</strong>: Plugins that only have output slots. Represents sources of data, which can 
be anything from user input to execution context values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modulators</strong>: Plugins with both in- and outputs. Can be considered filters and represent
operations on data from one or more sources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Emitters</strong>: Plugins with only input slots. Usually provide final presentation of data 
which can be rendering, playback, recording or transmission to a remote receiver.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A few plugins have neither in- or outputs and these usually serve cosmetic purposes. One example is the
Annotation plugin, which provides a persistent on-canvas note or comment.</p>

<h3>Plugin implementation:</h3>

<p>The beginning of each plugin implementation starts with the declaration of a constructor function and its
assignment to a property in the <em>plugins</em> registry contained in the <em>E2</em> namespace. To avoid leaving
a dangling temporary variable around after load of the last registered plugin, this is typically simultaneously
assigned to the <em>E2.p</em> variable to aid in subsequent prototypical declaration of plugin methods.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><pre style="overflow: auto; white-space: pre">
E2.p = E2.plugins['filename_without_extension'] = function(core, node)
{
    this.desc = 'Text string describing the plugin and its operation.';

    this.input_slots = [ 
        {
            name: 'in', // Slot display name. Mandatory.
            dt: core.datatypes.FLOAT, // Data type. Mandatory.
            desc: 'Description of slot purpose to be shown in the info view.', // Mandatory.
            def: 0, // Default value. Optional.
            lo: 0, // Minimum legal value. Optional.
            hi: 10 // Maximum legal value. Optional.
        }, 
        ...
    ];

    this.output_slots = [
        {
            name: 'out',
            dt: core.datatypes.BOOL,
            desc: 'True if &lt;b&gt;in&lt;/b&gt; &gt; 0',
            def: true
        },
        ...
    ];

    this.state = {} // Optional. Declaration can be ommitted.
};
</pre>
</p>

<p>The name of the property of <em>E2.plugins</em> the constructor is assigned to must match the filename of the plugin
without extension, as well as the identifier used to register it in <em>plugins/plugins.json</em>.</p>

<p>In- and output slot arrays can be empty, but must be present. Slots declared at plugin creation time are
termed <em>static</em>, as opposed to slots created at run-time, which are called <em>dynamic</em>.</p>

<p>The state member object is automatically persisted and deserialized by the Core. If a plugin does not require
persistent state, the <em>plugin.state</em> member can be left undefined.</p>

<p>The plugin model is event driven. Event handlers are simply methods using reserved names that - if declared
by a given plugin - are automatically called by the Core when required. Plugins authors can
choose to implement any subset of these that are relevant for the behaviour of a given plugin.</p>

<h3>Plugin methods:</h3>

<h4>E2.p.prototype.reset = function()</h4>
<p>Called on plugin load, instantiation and when playback is stopped. If this method is omitted, it will not
be scheduled for forced update after playback has been stopped and resumed. For the same reason,
<code>generators</code> will almost always implement this method. See also: <code>stop()</code>.

<hr />

<h4>E2.p.prototype.destroy = function()</h4>
<p>If declared, this method will be called by the Core immediately before its parent Node is destroyed
along with all associated resources.</p>

<hr />

<h4>E2.p.prototype.play = function()</h4>
<p>Called immediately before graph playback begins.</p>

<hr />

<h4>E2.p.prototype.pause = function()</h4>
<p>Called immediately after graph playback is paused.</p>

<hr />

<h4>E2.p.prototype.stop = function()</h4>
<p>Called immediately after graph playback is stopped. Unlike reset, it will not be called as part of 
plugin initialisation or deserialisation.</p>

<hr />

<h4>E2.p.prototype.connection_changed = function(on, conn, slot)</h4>
<p>Called when the state of a given in- or outbound connection involving the plugin changes.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>on</strong> (boolean): True if a new connection was formed and false is an existing connection was deleted.</li>
	<li><strong>conn</strong> (connection instance): The object representing the connection that was just made ot is about
	to be destroyed. It has the following properties:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>src_node</strong> (node instance): The source node of the connection. If the connection is outbound, this
			 will be equivalent to the <strong>node</strong> parameter given to our construction function when the plugin is
			 first instantiated.</li>
			<li><strong>dst_node</strong> (node instance): The destination node of the connection. If the connection is inbound, this
			 will similarly be equivalent to the <strong>node</strong> parameter given to our construction function when the plugin is
			 first instantiated.</li>
			<li><strong>src_slot</strong> (slot instance): The originating slot (see <code>update_input()</code> below for more details).</li>
			<li><strong>dst_slot</strong> (slot instance): The destination slot.</li>
			<li><strong>ui</strong> (connectionui instance): Only set when the plugin is on the currently active canvas and false
			 otherwise.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>slot</strong> (slot declaration): The slot of this plugin involved in the operation. Checking
	 slot.type for equality with E2.slot_type.input or E2.slot_type.output can be used to determine whether
	 the changed connection is in- or outbound.</li>
</ul>

<p>This method is typically implemented when a plugin needs to respond to disconnection from inbound sources of
data, but has other uses as well. Plugins that allow connection of any data type to be made to or from them, i.e.
that declares slots (whether static or dynamic) of type <code>ANY</code>, make use of this functionality to adapt
the data type of their own slots to that of the slot they're being connected to and to reset the data type of the
slot back to <code>ANY</code> when a connection to the relevant slot is destroyed. See also: 
<code>LinkedSlotGroup</code> in the Advanced topics section below.</p>

<hr />

<h4>E2.p.prototype.update_input = function(slot, data)</h4>
<p>Called whenever an inbound connection has new data to deliver. </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>slot</strong>: The slot that received the data</li>
	<li><strong>data</strong>: The new data value. This is guranteed to be of the correct type and match that of 
	the slot, although not all datatypes are guaranteed to have a <i>specified</i> value. For all datatypes that are
	legally allowed to have no value such as Textures, an undefined value will always be <code>null</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>slot</strong> parameter is an object containing the following members:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>slot.desc</strong> (string): Slot description.</li>
	<li><strong>slot.dt</strong> core.datatypes reference.
	<li><strong>slot.index</strong> (integer): Static slot index. Equivalent to the index of the corresponding slot declaration as
	specified in the contructor function of the plugin.</li>
	<li><strong>slot.is_connected</strong> (boolean): Indicates whether the slot is currently connected.</li>
	<li><strong>slot.name</strong> (string): The slot name as show in the UI.</li>
	<li><strong>slot.type</strong> (integer): The slot type. Either E2.slot_type.input or .output as appropriate.</li>
	<li><strong>slot.uid</strong> (integer): <em>Optional</em> &#8211; only present if this is a dynamic slot.</li>
</ul>

<p>To check which static slot is currently receiving input <strong>slot.index</strong> is used. The data can either be
stored in plugin trainsient state by storing it in an arbitrary class property, be stored in the persisted
<strong>plugin.state</strong> object, change UI state in response on incoming data and so on.</p>

<p>If the plugin declares dynamic slots, whether <strong>slot.uid</strong> is defined can be used to differenciate
between input to dynamic vs. static slots. Remember that <strong>slot.uid</strong> can legally be zero, so use
<code>(slot.uid !== undefined)</code> to check for this.</p>

<hr />

<h4>E2.p.prototype.update_state = function()</h4>
<p>Called once every frame after all calls to <code>update_input()</code> has completed, if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One or more of the connected input slots have changed value.</li>
	<li>This plugin has no output slots.</li>
	<li>This plugin has no input slots.</li>
	<li>This plugin is a nested graph <i>and</i> doesn't have its .always_update property set to <strong>false</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>E2.p.prototype.update_output = function(slot)</h4>

<p>Called once for every connected output slot if <code>update_state()</code> was previously called this frame.
Like <code>update_input()</code>, the <strong>slot</strong> parameter is the instance of the slot of this plugin being polled.</p>

<hr />

<h4>E2.p.prototype.create_ui = function()</h4>

<p>Called when the canvas on which the plugin resides is being switched to for editing. </p>

<p>jQuery is guaranteed to be available globally, so <strong>$</strong> can be used, although the used of jQuery,
especially for event handling is discouraged in production code for performance reasons.</p>

<p>Plugin implementators can create any nested set of DOM objects here, set up their own event
handling and anything else they might like. When done, <code>create_ui()</code> is expected to return the
root DOM element created, which will be dynamically shown on the surface of the plugin instance
whenever visible in the editor.</p>

<hr />

<h4>E2.p.prototype.state_changed = function(ui)</h4>
<p>This method is called once after plugin creation or deserialization with <strong>ui</strong> set to <em>null</em>. This call
can be used to do fundamental plugin instance initialization. If the plugin declares a UI, this method
will be called seperately with <code>ui</code> equal to the root DOM element returned by <code>create_ui()</code> earlier.</p>

<h3>Other reserved plugin member names:</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>id</strong> (string): The plugin type name as declared in <em>plugins/plugins.json</em>.</li>
	<li><strong>updated</strong> (boolean): Flag indicating whether any input slots have updated this frame and whether
	<code>update_state()</code> need to be called as a consequence.</li>
	<li><strong>e2_is_graph</strong> (boolean): A special state-flag used to identity nested graphs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Core class interfaces:</h3>

<h4>Node</h4>

<h4>Node.prototype.get_disp_name = function()</h4>
<p>Returns the string currently being used for the visible header of the node.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Node.prototype.add_slot = function(slot_type, def)</h4>
<p>Adds a new dynamic slot to the current node.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>slot_type</strong>: Either E2.slot_type.input or E2.slot_type.output.</li>
	<li><strong>def</strong>: Slot definition. An object equivalent of a static slot definition.</li>
	<li><strong>returns</strong>: A unique integer slot id.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Node.prototype.remove_slot = function(slot_type, suid)</h4>
<p>Removes a dynamic slot from this node.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>slot_type</strong>: Either E2.slot_type.input or E2.slot_type.output.</li>
	<li><strong>suid</strong>: Unique id of slot to remove.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Node.prototype.find_dynamic_slot = function(slot_type, suid)</h4>
<p>Returns the slot definition for a given dynamic slot.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>slot_type</strong>: Either E2.slot_type.input or E2.slot_type.output.</li>
	<li><strong>suid</strong>: Unique id of slot to remove.</li>
	<li><strong>returns</strong>: A slot definition or <strong>null</strong> if the slot could not be found.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Node.prototype.rename_slot = function(slot_type, suid, name)</h4>
<p>Renames the specified slot.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>slot_type</strong>: Either E2.slot_type.input or E2.slot_type.output.</li>
	<li><strong>suid</strong>: Unique id of slot to remove.</li>
	<li><strong>name</strong>: Desired new name for the specified slot.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Node.prototype.change_slot_datatype = function(slot_type, suid, dt)</h4>
<p>Changes the data type of the specified slot. Unless the new data type is ANY,
existing connection to or from the specified slot are destroyed.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>slot_type</strong>: Either E2.slot_type.input or E2.slot_type.output.</li>
	<li><strong>suid</strong>: Unique id of slot to remove.</li>
	<li><strong>dt</strong>: Desired new data type for the specified slot.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Core</h4>

<h4>Core.get_default_value = function(dt)</h4>
<p>Returns the default value for the supplied data type.</p>

<h3>Common pitfalls:</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Performing computation in <code>update_output()</code></strong>:
	Since output slots can be connected to more than once receiver concurrently, <code>update_output()</code> will be
	called once for each outbound connection that&#8217;s attached when the Core detects a successful run of
	<code>update_state()</code>. Thus calculations should always be performed in <code>update_state()</code> which will at most
	be run once per frame, and cached later to be returned on request from <code>update_output()</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced topics:</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>WebGL rendering</strong>:
	The current WebGL graphics context of the active rendering canvas can be obtained via the <code>core</code> parameter
	supplied to the plugin constructor function as: <strong>core.renderer.context</strong></p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Computing and caching output values in <code>update_input()</code></strong>:
	As an exception to the above rule, it is possible is very simple cases to perform a calculation directly
	in <code>update_input()</code> and cache it for later emission by <code>update_output()</code>, omitting implementation of
	<code>update_state()</code> which will yield slightly better performance. This can only be done where the calculation
	depend on the value of a single input only, since the update order of input slots are not guranteed. In
	cases where the result of a plugin depends on the value of more than one input, the input values must be
	cached and the calculation be performed in <code>update_state()</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, we can imagine a plugin which adds 1 to an input float value implement its <code>update_input()</code>
and <code>update_output()</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>E2.p.prototype.update_input = function(slot, data)
{
    // We have only one input, no need to mask on slot.index -- it will always be 0
    // 'data' is guaranteed to be a float.
    this.output_value = data + 1;
};

// No need for update_state() here...

E2.p.prototype.update_output = function(slot, data)
{
    return this.output_value;
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Blocking plugin data output based on logic in <code>update_state()</code></strong>:
	Whenever <code>update_state()</code> is called, it&#8217;s implied that the plugin <code>updated</code> property is <strong>true</strong>. It
	is possible for a plugin implementation to abort data output based on logic in <code>update_state()</code>by setting
	<code>updated</code> to <strong>false</strong>, in which case no calls to <code>update_output()</code> will occur.</li>
</ul>
