Meeting with Reaktor Polte (www.reaktorpolte.fi).

This meeting was with one guy, the head of Reaktor's investing arm, Oskari Kettunen (http://fi.linkedin.com/in/aokettun).

He has a coder background from 10 years ago, but has been working with the business side of things for a while now, specializing in lean startup, customer development, finding business models, monetization etc.

The meeting took 1.5 hours and I went over a powerpoint persentation, which is included here. The presentation went from presenting the team (that's us 2), to establishing that there are more and more commercial webGL projects happening, and in shapes and forms. The next part then shows what kind of companies will start to get webGL projects to do, using examples as companies in Helsinki (reaktor, sc5, whitesheep, etc). Then I talked a bit about the tools coming up for making WebGL, and where Engi stands in relation to those. Then I spent a while demoing Engi, and talked about node based interfaces in general (nuke, quartz composer). And finally we discussed monetization & business models.

He was very impressed about Engi, and cautiously interested in investing. He said it's slightly out of his personal comfort zone (he's more used to finding business models in webservices made for the general public) but called it a very special case that now needs special studying. 

So he wants me to compile an "information packet" of all the material we have. Links to WebGL projects, technical specs that we have, any stats and info we have about the market in general, the tech in general, etc. Basically whatever I can gather that can help our case. 
Also he said that maybe it would be cool if we could give them some kind of access to try Engi with some of the programmers they have in the company. 

So I'm now compiling that, and will send it to him shortly. They said that it's now up to us to make them an investment offer when we are ready with presenting our case. After we do so, they will reply in maximum of a week. 

He also said their investment contracts and conditions just use the standard forms found at seriesseed.com (http://www.seriesseed.com/posts/documents.html), and they don't want to buy a big part of the company (as they also don't give huge investments). I've studied their previous investments, and they are ranging from 40k to 200k. I've thought of a plan on what to ask them, and I can discuss it in the chat in detail.

So action plan is:
-I'm compiling and sending them an info pack about Engi & WebGL & Node systems.
-You can think about if we want to give them access to Engi.
-If we do that, i will make an updated snippets list with a "demo & tutorial" section.
-There's a couple of bugs that would need fixing before letting anyone in there (or maybe revert a couple versions back instead).
-I would also release our new webpage in some form, I think it would help our case a bit.

OK! That's it :D See you soon!
